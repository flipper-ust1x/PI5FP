this is currently not usable and is still under development.
this firmware is ment for the raspberry pi 5 16GB(RAM) variant.

BOOTLOADER
PINN is the chosen bootloader for this firmware. The reason PINN was chosen was for the recovery options and the dual boot options that allows us to put the full os,
and the recovery/fallback os(safe mode/if ubuntu fails) into the same sd card. for this firmware PINN has been modified by changing the background and icons.
